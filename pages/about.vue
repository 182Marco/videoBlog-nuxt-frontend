      Bio : I'm a filmmaker skilled in Digital contents and short docus for
      advertising and fashion industry. Born in Milan in 1990, since I was a kid
      I developed a more and more consistent interest and passion in cinema
      movies and production. After I graduated in Business Communication in IULM
      - Milan, I decided to move to Los Angeles following my passion and I
      achieved a Master Degree in Film Direction at UCLA. After studying and
      working in LA as a filmmaker, I went back to Milan, where I started
      working as Digital Creator for fashion and commercial brands like PMI,
      Stone Island, Marieclaire, Pandora, Grazia, Versace, Philosophy, Alberta
      Ferretti and others. I have a positive, fresh and refined style. My skills
      in filming makes me agile and able to face and work well on any kind of
      project and production team. On the post production side, I can fully
      manage offline and online progress.
